- Install Python
	*Linux: sudo apt-get install python
	*Mac: brew install python

- Install PIP for packages
	*Linux: sudo apt-get install python-pip
	*Mac: brew install ???

- Install QGIS + SAGA
	* if on mac, make sure all dependencies are set in $PATH and $PYTHONPATH
	* will need to attach Processing toolbox to $PYTHONPATH
	----> find location in plugins/Manage and install plugins scroll down to processing. **NOTE: path should be to plugins, not to processing!
	* on linux, SAGA attachment to QGIS is tricky. ALSO MAKE SURE FAKE X SERVER IS INSTALLED!! 
		https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/224617/problem-getting-saga-activated-in-ubuntu-qgis-2-18-2
		----> follow procedure by Nez
		*https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_server/install.html
		*http://www.itopen.it/qgis-server-setup-notes/
	
- Install all scientific computing with pip 
	* HDBSCAN installation requires cython 

- Install Stata. 
	* License is server agnostic
	* add to path everywhere. 
	---> in mac, bash_profile and sublime bash
	---> in linux, .profile and .bashrc AND /root/.bashrc and /root/.profile
	https://download.stata.com/download/linux64_13/
	* set more off, permanently.
	* 

- Install pysqlite.
	* On linux: "sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev" then
		pip install pysqlite
		sudo apt install sqlite3

- Install spatialite.
	* On Mac:
		- brew install spatialite-tools 
			(requires gdal installed which comes with qgis)
	* On Linux:
		- Unfortunately this needs to be compiled from source. 
		- Follow instructions in https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/gis/install/spatialite/
		- Use most current working versions instead of what django suggests. 
		- ./configure will fail many times and it is necessary to incrementally install apps (proj4, geos and others!) and fix bugs until it runs completely. Then sudo make && sudo make install. 
		- useful links are: https://kobablog.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/how-to-find-and-install-the-missing-file-in-ubuntu/ (apt-file search method) AND https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=836133 (libxml2-dev is necessary) AND https://packages.debian.org/sid/libreadosm-dev 
		-search for spatialite_mod in /usr/local/lib. 
		-> only spatialitelib is necessary, not spatialite-tools (which is different than spatialite_tool) --- but CLI comes with spatialite-tools.
		-> Add Libs to $PATH in .profile and .bashrc

- ODBC setup.
	* On Mac:
		- brew install unixodbc
		- get sqlite3 driver at http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/
		- files are: ~/.odbcinst.ini ~/.odbc.ini and for sytem:
			/Library/ODBC/odbcinst.ini  /Library/ODBC/odbc.ini 
		  --->stata only reads user DBS
		- follow this: http://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/drivers/
		- NOTE: I suspect that iODBC is actually what is used and installed here. 
				Seems like it may be installed by default. If the stata command 
				"odbc li" does not return an error, no need to install unixodbc!!!!
	* On Linux:
		1. sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev unixodbc-bin unixodbc
		2. sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libodbc.so /usr/lib/libiodbc.so 
		--> this fools stata into thinking that iODBC is installed
		3. cd $HOME
		4. wget http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/sqliteodbc-0.9995.tar.gz 
		5. tar -xvf sqliteodbc-0.9995.tar.gz
		6. cd sqliteodbc-0.9995
		7. sudo ./configure && sudo make && sudo make install
		8. files fill up ~/.odbcinst.ini ~/.odbc.ini (DRIVERS ARE .so)
		check : https://askubuntu.com/questions/708683/how-do-i-install-sqlite3-odbc-drivers-with-unixodbc
		AND http://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/drivers/

- Setup Git for AWS:
	1. cd into Code folder on Server
	2. git clone https://github.com/spolloni/SA . 
		(PERIOD IS IMPORTANT HERE)
	3. git config credential.helper store
	4. git pull
