	- title slides with outcome (or just take out plotting regression coefficients)
	- a lot less preamble about data construction
	- include buttons to diff-in-diff/means for bblu
	- emphasize that there could be false-positives in the placebo (still constructed)
	- think through how to interpret these areas
	- add T-stat descriptive table just in case??
	- area measure on descriptive table drops one major outlier
