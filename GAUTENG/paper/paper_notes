	ยก! Stef Presentation !ยก (10/2/18)

- best we can do in this setting because project locations are not-random (use (1) planned but unconstructed, (2) )
- shacks are interesting, because arguably property rights are assigned, kind of formal housing because of the property rights (andrew)
	- great point; services??  be 
- jesse question? couldn't hear ...

- dan : constrained by how property rights are affected ?
	- another question?

- bryce : are these prices that people are paying ? (are poor people actually paying these prices)

- matt : were all 3 million formal housing units are sold ? why do you have less ? 

- emily : question about transaction distribution, clarification about where prices are??

- matt : what about those not intersecting with price data? where are other things??  [ what was the joke?! ]

- somebody : where are subsidy values coming from??

- bryce : deeds data are the universe?? same question again??

- dan : balance table??

- [ joke! about including projects?! ]

- ana aizer : how do you know how the boundaries are drawn ??   andrew jumped in [about data mining] ??

- andrew : question fraction exposure measure ??  use the continuous measure maybe ?? [didn't catch the full discussion but sounded good]

- jesse : going in on forward-looking behavior?  emily made a joke I didn't hear..

- emily : asks a question about formal vs informal distinction : wondering what she's learning about the census regs? [fair] ??  andrew jumps in and asks about whether informal increases informal?  there is some interesting thing to contend with?? 

	- maybe houses would just crowd in anyways? like not clear whats going to happen!

- matt : care about the aggregate impact of these things, where are people coming in; care about how the effect of people who live in the buffer area and the treated area  (kind of helpful?)

- jesse is jumping in about noise in data?? [ big joke? andrew?? ]

- dan : asking about balancing again .. reason is to think about the counterfactual, if holding that land as government; would it be developing as its own?  does this seem like a great comparison?  [ nice point ]   andrew : are there more people here as a result of construction ?  (good question)

- matt : suppose everybody ends up in a newly constructed nice house as owner; if that is what is happening; what would happen to the owner column?  [ good answer ] or renting out another thing

- bryce or emily, can't tell, something about moving out of houses ; something about model of behavior

- andrew : land has to be cleared right?  virigin land? how can pop go down!?

- matt : if you go to left, you're getting further and further from the border, restrict tighter to the border?

- bryce : something about land or something?? something what we are asking is kind of about your hypothesis? or is it obvious? not sure, but good job tangoing with her!  emily jumped in but we don't know...  relative to what, what is the counterfactual..... emily is going on about something if people build this, or that or whatever...

- andrew : jumping in on your substitution argument with an idea

- bryce : says some nonsense about what's going on

- ana : look at another outcome?? like the quality is going up??  going back to motivation

- dan : question at the takeaway of BBLU ??
	- then a jokE! what was it!?

- matt : something about the price definition??

- andrew : ask something about the prices??

- matt : develop this one region; created backyard and developed area; so what should happen is something like all the people move to the nicer informal housing, people are left with worse housing stock; composition effect of people [ good idea ? ]
