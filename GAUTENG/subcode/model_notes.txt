key findings : 

	- total change in structures and population is zero

	- greater share of formal to informal

	- no changes nearby in (1) prices, (2) density, or (3) census


interpretations : 

	- simplest story:
		- no externalities
		- people's houses are upgraded
			- space constraint means population can't change
			- owners enjoy greater rents and quality
			- everything else is the same (all balanced against outside option)



	- what would happen in a matt/rossihansburg model?
		- 



	- wrong counterfactual -> people have zero moving costs, substitution is coming from far away...
		- BUT : that would predict an increase in population in the area...
