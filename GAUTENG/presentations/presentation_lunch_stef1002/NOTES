        -- Galiani et al. [2017]: Positive effect on overall housing conditions and general well-being.
        -- Barnhardt et al. [2015]: Housing lottery: no change in Family Income or Human Capital.
        -- Picarelli [2017]: Female participation in labor force decrease, 1 SD decrease
        -- Franklin [2018]: Increase Household Income driven by Female participation in labor force.
