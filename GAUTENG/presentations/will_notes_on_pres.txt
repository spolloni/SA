9/29/18 :
	
	- title slides with outcome (or just take out plotting regression coefficients)
	- a lot less preamble about data construction
	- include buttons to diff-in-diff/means for bblu
	- emphasize that there could be false-positives in the placebo (still constructed)
	- think through how to interpret these areas
	- add T-stat descriptive table just in case??
	- area measure on descriptive table drops one major outlier


9/30/18 :

	- squatters rights and leftover government land
	- ditch the dichotemy, purchased from farmers
	- ideal experiment: 2 candidate land plots one commit to building, other commit to never building on it

	- turn weakness into strength !!! 

	- dosage average exposure


	- We don't need it !!! :  T-Test: scalar for T-stat in spillover and treatment

	- Small area level in the note

	- Replace DD with postXcomp

	- D is for year not for distance?? 

	- button with treated and placebo treatment

	- empirical specification : discuss the double-counting ; bring it up when you show the map 

	- decomposition of informal structures

	- transaction densities as button

	- only sold once



	** ** economics ** **
	
	- houses getting way better
	- Owner insignificance means that people are renting them
	- density maybe goes down in project, maybe goes up nearby


	- insignificantly more structures and less people in RDPs
