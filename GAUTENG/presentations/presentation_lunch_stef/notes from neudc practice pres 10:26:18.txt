- standard errors:
	- presenting: be upfront about power
	- weight by project size
	- group all inside together
	- boost sample

- anticipation effects:
	- break apart analysis by project timing

- demographic outcomes for CBD heterogeneity:
	- age, marital status

- economies of scale in construction of houses

- sell triple-diff?
